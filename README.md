# Energy-consumption-Contiki
This project in Contiki uses the Energest module to estimate energy consumption of a node. 
The energy consumption is calculated by multiply the voltage and the current altogether with a duration which the 
sensor node spends for operating. Voltage and current are taken from Tmote Sky sensor datasheet.
