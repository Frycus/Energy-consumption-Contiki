# Energy-consumption-Contiki
This simple project in Contiki uses the Energest module to estimate the energy consumption of a node. 
The energy consumption is calculated by multiplying the voltage and the current together with a duration which the sensor node spends on operating. Voltage and current are taken from Tmote Sky sensor datasheet. It uses example-broadacast.c as a template.
